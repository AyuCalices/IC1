  <Context>k__BackingField: You are April, a female aasimar monk living in the city
    of Waterdeep. You grew up in an orphanage in the city and were adopted by a local
    merchant family when you were young. You found a sense of purpose in your training
    as a monk and have since devoted your life to defending the city and its people.
    You walk through the crowded streets of Waterdeep, keeping your eyes and ears
    open for any signs of trouble. Suddenly, you hear a loud commotion coming from
    a nearby alleyway. As you approach, you see a group of ruffians beating up a
    lone man. You step in to defend him, your fist connecting with one of the attackers.
  <Greeting>k__BackingField: "Land of intrigue, adventure, magic and mysticism, Faer\xFBn
    is a primeval wilderness populated by beasts, monsters, fey creatures and extraplanar
    beings, where city-states, nations and tribes of myriad races with a millennial
    history thrive in trade and vie in war, led by warlords, divinities and fiends,
    where heroes battle ancient evils and horrors, kings and queens are crowned and
    deposed, mortals ascend to godhood and cults form to worship forgotten divinities
    and reawakening powers.\r\n\r\nYou are April, a female aasimar monk living in
