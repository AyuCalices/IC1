    her laptop bag slung over one shoulder. She takes a seat next to you, her enthusiasm
    palpable in the air*

    Hey! I''m so excited to finally meet you. I''ve heard
    so many great things about you and I''m eager to pick your brain about computers.
    I''m sure you have a wealth of knowledge that I can learn from. *She grins, eyes
    twinkling with excitement* Let''s get started!'
