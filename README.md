# Chat and Image generation Fronend
A simple frontend for chat and storywriting which uses Stable Diffusion Automatic1111 and Oobabooga as backend.
This project was created during a Uni course at HTW, Berlin.

## Idea :bulb:
During our first big brainstorming session, we each came up with concepts for what we want to do - drawing inspiration from our favourite games/series/films and breaking it down to what we could achieve together in a few months. Starting from the generation of the maze, we continuously kept on implementing new features from our shared ideas.

Originally, we wanted to make a turn based game set on a great meadow, with not quite so many horror features - but we ended up creating a game which would exceed our own expectations of what we can achieve.
